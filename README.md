<h2>7/8 Update</h2>
We've finished the lion's share of the actual work, and now we're debugging, optimizing and tweaking. The site is now a fully functional slideshow on any device over 600px. Since the site will work entirely differently on mobile devices, a majority of the remaining work is to modify the way the listeners work to prevent scrolling so that they behave differently when you're on mobile.
